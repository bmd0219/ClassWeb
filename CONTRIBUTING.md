## <a id="working"></a> Working

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

    1.Fork the repo on GitHub
    2.Clone the project to your own machine
    3.Commit changes to your own branch
    4.Push your work back up to your fork
    5.Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes
Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!


**NOTE:**

Never push directly to main repository (upstream). Only push to your forked repo (origin) and send a pull request to
the main repository
